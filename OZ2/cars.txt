STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
Cars were selected at random from among 1993 passenger car models that
were listed in both the _Consumer Reports_ issue and the _PACE Buying
Guide_.  Pickup trucks and Sport/Utility vehicles were eliminated due
to incomplete information in the _Consumer Reports_ source.  Duplicate
models (e.g., Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance) were listed at most
once.

A similar dataset for 1989 model cars appeared as one of the sample
datasets shipped with the _Student Edition of Execustat_ (PWS-KENT
1990).

Further description can be found in the "Datasets and Stories" article
"1993 New Car Data" in the _Journal of Statistics Education_ (Lock 1993).
